 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
A function is a callable.
A method is a special class of function, one that can be bound or unbound. (An unbound method cannot be called.)
They all look the same, they just have different naming conventions. Under the hood, the objects may look vastly different though.

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Constructor is basicaly used for initialising the variables at the time of creation of object. Constructors are used for allocating memory space for variables. It is special funtion which getsactivated automatically when object of that class is created.
